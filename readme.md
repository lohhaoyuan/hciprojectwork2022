OurHCI is a social media platform for Hwa Chong students made using Django meant to serve as not only a socialising platform but also a stage for students to freely express their thoughts. ~~Unfortunately, as this is a project for School, there is **censorship**.~~

Politically incorrect posts ~~must~~ will be tagged with "This post has controversial content" for example, and there will be student moderators who review posts flagged or reported by other students. Repeatedly posting sh\*t will result in a drop in "social credit", a reputation system which will inform users of how trustworthy a person's posts might be.
