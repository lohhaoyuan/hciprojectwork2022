# OurHCI
### Lightning Fast. Extremely Secure. A culmination of six months of 100% hard work with absolutely no slacking.

Most people use social media an average of every moment of their lives per hour. Majority of their social media use is toxic, which is bad.

The solution? A completely moderated, student-developed social platform, for students.

OurHCi was developed by four Secondary One students in Hwa Chong Institution (High School Section), hoping to not only help new students assimilate into a new environment, but also serve as a long-term communication platform for students.

### Building OurHCI

OurHCI relies on the Django framework, hence you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Run ```pip install Django```.

```cd``` into the directory of the project containing the "manage.py" file, and run ```python manage.py runserver```.

Now, open (127.0.0.1:8000)[127.0.0.1:8000) in your search browser, and embrace the Hwa Chong spirit of...**communism**.

**We** hope that you enjoy **Our**Project made for **Our**PW in **Our**School.
